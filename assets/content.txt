			h1: Hospital Safety Requires Responsive Security Services

			The safety and security in healthcare establishments is a top priority.  Let us balance patient safety with hospital safety, as well as all the confidentiality requirements, governmental and accreditation standards, and patient satisfaction scores that frequently give people headaches.

			Failing in this can cause loss of reputation and a generally bad time. We can take care of that.

			h1: Specialized Service Tailored to Your Healthcare Needs

			People trust us because we say so because this is our website.  Your tailored hospital security service includes:
			- Highly trained, but slightly overweight, specialist who may or may not know how to shoot.
			- Unparalleled customer service when/if you can reach us.
			- Customized security programs to help you not cry.

			h1:Your Partner for Safe and Enjoyable Shopping Experiences
			
			Retail people, their employees, shoppers, and even food court "foodies" want to feel safe and sound when doing their thing. If you have an incident, they will probably never come back to your store ever again.
			
			Shopping centers and malls have unique things that should be taken into account when designing a security system. This means you need us because we have lots of imaginary experience providing retail security solutions.
			
			h1:Our Retail Security Professionals Put Your Customers' Safety First

			We get you and have days of experience providing barely skilled security professionals who deliver white-ish glove service to the mall and shopping center industry. Our shopping mall officers can:
			- Ride on those Segway things while looking completely non-menacing
			- Attempt to control crowds through the loudspeaker
			- Attempt to deter theft
			- Respond fast-ish when someone IS stealing something
			- Assist in medical emergencies by dialing 911
			- Find lost children using candy and vans
			- Patrol parking areas and sleep in their car
